heading: "Manipulating !important styles"

You don't need to use JavaScript to take advantage of Cleanslate. However, if you do want to manipulate a Cleanslated element with JavaScript, then you will find that you cannot change its styles by manipulating the `elem.style` object, as you might normally. Instead, you will need to edit its `elem.style.cssText` property, or change its `style` attribute:

    elem.style.border = "red";                            // won't work
    elem.style.border = "red !important";                 // won't work
    elem.style.cssText = "border: red !important";        // WILL work
    elem.setAttribute("style", "border: red !important"); // WILL work
    
    jQuery(elem).css("border", "red");                    // won't work
    jQuery(elem).css("border", "red !important");         // won't work
    jQuery(elem).attr("style", "border: red !important"); // WILL work

If you are using jQuery, you can use the ['Important' plugin](https://github.com/premasagar/important) to make this process much more easy. With this, you can add `true` as a third argument to the `css()` method:

    jQuery(elem).css("border", "red", true);

or turn on `!important` handling by default:

    jQuery.important();
    jQuery(elem).css("border", "red");

or make an element's styles use `!important`:

    jQuery(elem).important();

or not:

    jQuery(elem).important(false);
